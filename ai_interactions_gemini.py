    }

    **Instructions:**
    - **Use the Same Quests:**
        - Do not change the quests from the example.
        - Ensure the quests are exactly as defined in the example, including the quest names and descriptions.
    - **Quest Structure:**
        - Each quest should have the following fields:
            - `description`: As provided.
            - `completed`: Set to **false**.
            - `required_items`: A list of item names required to complete the quest.
            - `required_npcs`: A list of NPC names that need to be defeated to complete the quest.
    - **Placement:**
        - **Final Boss NPC and Ancient Artifact:**
            - Place both the `final_boss` NPC and the `ancient_artifact` item (type: `scroll`) in the **same location**.
            - For the `vanquish_final_boss` quest, set `required_npcs` to `["final_boss"]`.
            - For the `retrieve_ancient_artifact` quest, set `required_items` to `["ancient_artifact"]`.
            - Don't place the quest items in hidden items.
        - **Mystic Gem:**
            - Place the `mystic_gem` (type: `healing` with full heal capacity) in a **different location**.
            - For the `find_mystic_gem` quest, set `required_items` to `["mystic_gem"]`.
    - **Complete All Entries:**
        - Define between **8 to 12** unique locations without using placeholders like `{...}`.
        - Ensure all necessary fields (`description`, `npcs`, `items`, `connections`, `locked_paths`, `hidden_items`, `traps`) are present for each location.
    - **Maintain Consistency:**
        - Follow the same JSON structure as the example above.
        - Ensure that locations, items, and NPCs are interconnected logically.
    - **Include Traps in Locations:**
        - **Trap Definition:** Each location may include a `traps` key with traps defined as:
            - `description`: A description of the trap.
            - `damage`: The amount of HP the player loses if the trap is triggered.
            - `disarm_difficulty`: Difficulty level for disarming the trap (`"simple"`, `"challenging"`, `"very_challenging"`).
            - `triggered`: Set to `false`.
        - **Distribution:** Include between **0 to 2** traps per location, with most locations having **0 or 1** traps.
    - **Configure Locked Paths and Keys:**
        - **Locked Paths:** lock **4 to 6** paths in total across all locations.
        - **Locked Paths:** All paths leading to the final boss location must be **locked**.
        - **Keys Availability:** Provide **more keys** (e.g., 2 times the number of locked paths) to ensure players can progress through the game.
    - **Include Hidden Items:** Keep the hidden items empty for all locations
    - **Logical Location Connections:**
        - **Connectivity:** Ensure that all locations are connected logically, allowing smooth navigation.
        - **Final Boss Location:** Design the final boss location (e.g., `cursed_castle`) to be the **most challenging to reach**, requiring multiple keys or steps.
    - **Distribute Item Types Based on Probabilities:**
        - **Item Type Distribution:**
            - **Tool:** 10%
            - **Weapon:** 20%
            - **Healing:** 50%
            - **Key:** 30%
        - **Implementation:** Ensure that the distribution of item types across all locations adheres to these probabilities.
    - **Player Statistics Configuration:**
        - **Player Stats:**
            - `max_hp`: Range between **80 to 140**.
            - `attack`: Range between **6 to 14**.
            - `xp`: Set to **0**.
            - `level`: Set to **1**.
            - `xp_to_next_level`: Choose from **50, 75, or 100**.
            - `inventory`: Include between **2 to 4** items.
    - **JSON Formatting and Validation:**
        - **Format:** Ensure the game state is a **well-structured** and **error-free** JSON object.
        - **Syntax:** Properly use commas, quotes, braces, and brackets.
        - **Validation:** The JSON must pass standard JSON validation checks without errors.
    - **Output Requirements:**
        - **Content Only:** Return **only** the JSON object without any variable assignments, explanations, or additional text.
        - **No Extra Messages:** The output should be clean, containing solely the JSON structure.
